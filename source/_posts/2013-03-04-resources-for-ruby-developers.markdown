As someone (Probably a really famous guy whose name I cannot remember) once said
becoming a software developer means having to learn new things for the rest of 
your life.

This is just as true for Ruby as for any other language so here are the
resources I like to use to keep up to date.

These are besides things like API sites and the ruby on rails guides etc.

<!--more-->

## [Railscasts](http://railscasts.com)

Made by Ryan Biggs, Railscasts is a great site with webcasts exploring new and
interesting things happening in the ruby world. As the name suggests it is more
focused on Web Development and Ruby on Rails but it also explores technology
that can be useful to other types of ruby developers.

There are free and paid-for episodes available (for US$9 per month) and every
episode has source code avilable on github. Most episodes also have full 
transcripts, including code, which can be read if you are not a video-watching
type.

## [Confreaks](http://confreaks.com)

If you do not have money to travel the world attending conferences and your 
company does not stump up the cash then Confreaks is a gem of a site. They
record presentations at a lot of major development conferences.

Confreaks is very popular with ruby conferences so you can find a wealth of 
interesting talks there. (Most of the talks are about 40-60 minutes long 
which is perferct for filling up a lunch break while eating or watching on the
daily commute)

## [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com)

Hacker News is a (mostly) news aggregation site that has reasonable high
standards of submissions and comments. Like all aggregation sites it has plenty
of stories that do not interest me directly but there is a lot of good technical
news / startup news there.

Requires a bit more mental filtering but still worth it. Just be aware that it 
is quite start-up focused which can cause a bit of an echo chamber effect. A 
healthy dose of cynicism (realism?) is useful.

## [Reddit](http://reddit.com)

Ah, Reddit, the "Front page of the internet" and a hell of a good time-waster.
Beware of this site in that regard.

Reddit has various subforums related to specialised topics. For the Ruby
developer about town the following Reddits may prove useful:

* [Ruby](http://reddit.com/r/ruby)
* [Ruby on Rails](http://reddit.com/r/rubyonrails)
* [Webdev](http://reddit.com/r/webdev)

## [Ruby5](http://ruby5.envylabs.com)

Ruby5 is a podcast from the gents at Envy Labs which covers interesting ruby 
related things. They are relatively short and to the point (About 5 minutes)

To be honest, I do not listen to the podcast that often but they list each tech
they talk about on the page for that episode which is what I usually have a look 
at.

## [RubyShow](http://rubyshow.com)

In the same manner as Ruby5 above this podcast talks about interesting things
going on in the ruby world. The podcasts from Rubyshow are a lot longer than 
ruby5.

Again like Ruby5 I mainly use this site for the list of technologies they have
in the transcript rather than listening to the podcast itself. (Aren't I an
old fashioned duffer...)

## [Webpulp](http://webpulp.tv)

While I am mainly a ruby dev I am also resposible for other aspects such as 
server administration etc. (Not my main job but hey).

Webpulp.tv is basically a series of interviews with employees of quite famous
tech related companies. 

The interviews usually focus on the technology used by the company, challenges
they have faced and how they got around them etc. 

It is exceedingly useful to see what others are using in their stacks and a good
way to learn about new and interesting software / techniques that might be 
useful for you. 

Unfortunately webpulp does not update very often but what the hey.

## Company blogs

As well as the above I have blogs by various ruby related companes on an RSS
feed. for example:

* [37Signals](http://37signals.com/svn)
* [EngineYard](http://www.engineyard.com/blog)
* [Thoughtbot](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/)

You should find companies doing stuff that interest you and sign up to their blogs

## Other things

If you have read this far then I thank you for your attention and would like to 
use it to remind you of one thing.

Everything above is optional. What you should be doing anyway is being signed up
to the security mailing lists of all the major components in your stack. 

For example if you you Ruby on Rails with PostgreSQL and Redis datastores and a
Varnish cache running on CentOS then you should be signed up to the security 
mailing lists of all of these.

## A Final Warning / Bit of Encouragement

I have listed a reasonable number of resources above. This list is no-where near
exhaustive and you should be building up your own list of go-to resources. As 
well as this you need to beware of something I call "Learner's Paralysis". 

Following all of the above sites (plus ones you find yourself) can take up a 
significant chunk of your time if you let it.

Do not let it take up so much that you end up reading / learning a lot more than
doing. This is a problem I suffer from, I find learning about these things so
interesting (at a superficial level) that I don't actually get round to *doing* 
anything. (Work on side-projects, think about that bootstrapped business 
I want to to start etc.)

Get out there and put the stuff to use rather than just thinking "Hey, I learned
something" and leaving it at that.
