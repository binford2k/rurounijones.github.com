    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As someone (Probably a really famous guy whose name I cannot remember) once said
becoming a software developer means having to learn new things for the rest of
your life.</p>

<p>This is just as true for Ruby as for any other language so here are the
resources I like to use to keep up to date.</p>

<p>These are besides things like API sites and the ruby on rails guides etc.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2><a href="http://railscasts.com">Railscasts</a></h2>

<p>Made by Ryan Biggs, Railscasts is a great site with webcasts exploring new and
interesting things happening in the ruby world. As the name suggests it is more
focused on Web Development and Ruby on Rails but it also explores technology
that can be useful to other types of ruby developers.</p>

<p>There are free and paid-for episodes available (for US$9 per month) and every
episode has source code avilable on github. Most episodes also have full
transcripts, including code, which can be read if you are not a video-watching
type.</p>

<h2><a href="http://confreaks.com">Confreaks</a></h2>

<p>If you do not have money to travel the world attending conferences and your
company does not stump up the cash then Confreaks is a gem of a site. They
record presentations at a lot of major development conferences.</p>

<p>Confreaks is very popular with ruby conferences so you can find a wealth of
interesting talks there. (Most of the talks are about 40-60 minutes long
which is perferct for filling up a lunch break while eating or watching on the
daily commute)</p>

<h2><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a></h2>

<p>Hacker News is a (mostly) news aggregation site that has reasonable high
standards of submissions and comments. Like all aggregation sites it has plenty
of stories that do not interest me directly but there is a lot of good technical
news / startup news there.</p>

<p>Requires a bit more mental filtering but still worth it. Just be aware that it
is quite start-up focused which can cause a bit of an echo chamber effect. A
healthy dose of cynicism (realism?) is useful.</p>

<h2><a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a></h2>

<p>Ah, Reddit, the &#8220;Front page of the internet&#8221; and a hell of a good time-waster.
Beware of this site in that regard.</p>

<p>Reddit has various subforums related to specialised topics. For the Ruby
developer about town the following Reddits may prove useful:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://reddit.com/r/ruby">Ruby</a></li>
<li><a href="http://reddit.com/r/rubyonrails">Ruby on Rails</a></li>
<li><a href="http://reddit.com/r/webdev">Webdev</a></li>
</ul>


<h2><a href="http://ruby5.envylabs.com">Ruby5</a></h2>

<p>Ruby5 is a podcast from the gents at Envy Labs which covers interesting ruby
related things. They are relatively short and to the point (About 5 minutes)</p>

<p>To be honest, I do not listen to the podcast that often but they list each tech
they talk about on the page for that episode which is what I usually have a look
at.</p>

<h2><a href="http://rubyshow.com">RubyShow</a></h2>

<p>In the same manner as Ruby5 above this podcast talks about interesting things
going on in the ruby world. The podcasts from Rubyshow are a lot longer than
ruby5.</p>

<p>Again like Ruby5 I mainly use this site for the list of technologies they have
in the transcript rather than listening to the podcast itself. (Aren&#8217;t I an
old fashioned duffer&#8230;)</p>

<h2><a href="http://webpulp.tv">Webpulp</a></h2>

<p>While I am mainly a ruby dev I am also resposible for other aspects such as
server administration etc. (Not my main job but hey).</p>

<p>Webpulp.tv is basically a series of interviews with employees of quite famous
tech related companies.</p>

<p>The interviews usually focus on the technology used by the company, challenges
they have faced and how they got around them etc.</p>

<p>It is exceedingly useful to see what others are using in their stacks and a good
way to learn about new and interesting software / techniques that might be
useful for you.</p>

<p>Unfortunately webpulp does not update very often but what the hey.</p>

<h2>Company blogs</h2>

<p>As well as the above I have blogs by various ruby related companes on an RSS
feed. for example:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://37signals.com/svn">37Signals</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.engineyard.com/blog">EngineYard</a></li>
<li><a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/">Thoughtbot</a></li>
</ul>


<p>You should find companies doing stuff that interest you and sign up to their blogs</p>

<h2>Other things</h2>

<p>If you have read this far then I thank you for your attention and would like to
use it to remind you of one thing.</p>

<p>Everything above is optional. What you should be doing anyway is being signed up
to the security mailing lists of all the major components in your stack.</p>

<p>For example if you you Ruby on Rails with PostgreSQL and Redis datastores and a
Varnish cache running on CentOS then you should be signed up to the security
mailing lists of all of these.</p>

<h2>A Final Warning / Bit of Encouragement</h2>

<p>I have listed a reasonable number of resources above. This list is no-where near
exhaustive and you should be building up your own list of go-to resources. As
well as this you need to beware of something I call &#8220;Learner&#8217;s Paralysis&#8221;.</p>

<p>Following all of the above sites (plus ones you find yourself) can take up a
significant chunk of your time if you let it.</p>

<p>Do not let it take up so much that you end up reading / learning a lot more than
doing. This is a problem I suffer from, I find learning about these things so
interesting (at a superficial level) that I don&#8217;t actually get round to <em>doing</em>
anything. (Work on side-projects, think about that bootstrapped business
I want to to start etc.)</p>

<p>Get out there and put the stuff to use rather than just thinking &#8220;Hey, I learned
something&#8221; and leaving it at that.</p>

    <link href="http://rurounijones.github.com/blog/2013/01/28/setting-up-japanese-input-on-kubuntu-12-dot-04/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-28T22:00:00+09:00</updated>
    <id>http://rurounijones.github.com/blog/2013/01/28/setting-up-japanese-input-on-kubuntu-12-dot-04</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Historically setting up Japanese input on Linux has been a trial-and-error
affair with much forum searching, dark config file incantations and other
black magic.</p>

<p>Luckily with Kubuntu 12.04 getting setup with Japanese input has become a very
simple process</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I am going to make a few assumptions before we get going. I am going to assume
that:</p>

<ol>
<li>You have installed Kubuntu 12.04 or later</li>
<li>You installed the English version.</li>
<li>You have not yet tried to setup Japanese text input yet.</li>
</ol>


<p>The reason for 1. is simply that I have not tested this on any earlier versions.
Feel free to give it a go and report back, but no guarantees.</p>

<p>The reason for 2. is again, because I have not tested it with other languages.
Again feel free to give it a go and report back, but no guarantees.</p>

<p>The reason for 3. is because, historically, attempting ot get Japanese input
working with one method would intefere with other attempts using different
methods. If you have already tried to setup Japanese input on your install then
by all means try the below method, but if it doesn&#8217;t work I am afraid that I
cannot help you. In this case the best (albeit annoying) option is to reinstall.</p>

<p>Right, with these caveats out of the way lets proceed.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install ibus-mozc gnome-icon-theme</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Run this command from the konsole. It will install the ibus-mozc software,
this has worked for me without issues. I used to use some different software but
this seems to be the way to go for 12.04 and up.</p>

<p>gnome-icon-theme is required by ibus-mozc (yes, even on KDE) but due to a
missing dependency it is not installed so we need to specify it here.</p>

<p>After running the above command there is a good chance that you will need to
restart, if prompted then please do so.</p>

<p>After rebooting go go to your system-settings and choose the locale option
(It is at the top under the &#8220;Common Appearance and Behavior&#8221; section).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://rurounijones.github.com/images/2013-01-28-setting-up-japanese-input-on-kubuntu-12-dot-04/kubuntu-system-settings.png"></p>

<p>In the left-hand list select &#8220;System Languages&#8221; and then in the right hand
window choose the &#8220;Set System Language&#8221; option.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://rurounijones.github.com/images/2013-01-28-setting-up-japanese-input-on-kubuntu-12-dot-04/kubuntu-locale.png"></p>

<p>In my case I choose &#8220;English (United Kingdom)&#8221; (Rule Britannia!) and then in
the bottom right of the window set the &#8220;Keyboard input method&#8221; to &#8220;ibus&#8221;</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://rurounijones.github.com/images/2013-01-28-setting-up-japanese-input-on-kubuntu-12-dot-04/kubuntu-set-system-language.png"></p>

<p>Clicking apply will require you to enter your root password.</p>

<p>Now we need to start ibus. One option is to reboot but the quicker way is to
bring up the app launcher by pressing ALT+F2 then typing in &#8220;ibus&#8221;. Doing so
will bring up the &#8220;IBus Input Method Framework&#8221; option, please click this.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://rurounijones.github.com/images/2013-01-28-setting-up-japanese-input-on-kubuntu-12-dot-04/kubuntu-launcher-ibus.png"></p>

<p>Clicking the above will result in a little keyboard icon coming into life in
your taskbar bottom right of the screen.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://rurounijones.github.com/images/2013-01-28-setting-up-japanese-input-on-kubuntu-12-dot-04/kubuntu-taskbar-ibus.png"></p>

<p>Right click on this icon and select &#8220;Preferences&#8221;. On the window that appears
select the &#8220;Input Method&#8221; tab.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://rurounijones.github.com/images/2013-01-28-setting-up-japanese-input-on-kubuntu-12-dot-04/kubuntu-ibus-preferences.png"></p>

<p>Check the &#8220;Customize active input methods&#8221; checkbox. Click the &#8220;Select an input
method&#8221;, click the little arrow next to the greyed out &#8220;Japanese&#8221; text then
click on the very orange icon with the &#8220;Mozc&#8221; text. Once that is done click
&#8220;Add&#8221;.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://rurounijones.github.com/images/2013-01-28-setting-up-japanese-input-on-kubuntu-12-dot-04/kubuntu-ibus-preferences-japanese-selected.png"></p>

<p>The orange icon with &#8220;Japanese - Mozc&#8221; should appear in the input method
list. At this point you can close the window.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://rurounijones.github.com/images/2013-01-28-setting-up-japanese-input-on-kubuntu-12-dot-04/kubuntu-ibus-preferences-japanese-added.png"></p>

<p>You should now be able to input Japanese! Open a text editor like Kate or a
browser. Select an area where you can enter text then use CTRL+Space, the
keyboard icon bottom right should switch to the orange icon and you can enter
Japanese. よし！</p>

    <link href="http://rurounijones.github.com/blog/2009/10/24/textile-filtering-with-redcloth/"/>
    <updated>2009-10-24T18:00:00+09:00</updated>
    <id>http://rurounijones.github.com/blog/2009/10/24/textile-filtering-with-redcloth</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to use RedCloth to let users of my rails app make textile formatted
posts but I wanted to restrict the input they were allowed to use. How to do
this? I thought it would be simple.</p>

<p><strong>Warning: This article was imported from an old site and is therefore itself
rather old. It may not still be accurate for current versions of RedCloth.</strong></p>

<!--more-->


<p>Textile has a +filter_html+ option which I thought would do the trick but that
only filters what HTML RedCloth allows users to enter. It doesn’t filter the
HTML created by Redcloth itself when a user uses textile tags.</p>

<p>So how to filter the textile tags?</p>

<p>First, assuming you are using Rails 2.3 or later create the following file.
For other frameworks please use the recommended method for adding start-up
code to that framework.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>config/initializers/redcloth_filter.rb</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This file will be run during the rails initialization and will contain the code
we want to override (monkey-patch). Now paste the following code into the file.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>config/initializers/redcloth_filter.rb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>ALLOWED_TAGS is a hash of tags that you want to allow. You can take the
<a href="http://redcloth.rubyforge.org/classes/RedCloth/Formatters/HTML.html">BASIC_TAGS</a>
to use as a base and strip tags you don’t want to allow from the hash and add
other ones if you want to.</p>

<p>So we have defined the tags that we want to allow. Now we need to actually do
some stripping. This is where the after_transform method comes in. This is
called by RedCloth as standard after initial modification. So what we can do is
override the method and tell RedCloth to clean_html again with the HTML string
it has just created. To give you a list of steps.</p>

<ul>
<li>RedCloth is configured with +filter_html+ enabled</li>
<li>User enters string (Textile and HTML)</li>
<li>RedCloth strips HTML tags from the string according to the BASIC_TAGS using
clean_html method</li>
<li>RedCloth converts the textile tags in the string to HTML</li>
</ul>


<p>At this point the HTML’ised string is usually returned; however we do some
overriding so that:</p>

<ul>
<li>RedCloth strips HTML tags from the above generated HTML string according to
our ALLOWED_TAGS using the clean_html method</li>
<li>RedCloth returns the twice filtered HTML string.</li>
</ul>


<p>Thinking about it you don’t even need +filter_html+ since it will all be
filtered the second time around explicitly by our code. However I feel a little
more secure by stripping all the user generated HTML cruft first using
+filter_html+ before stripping our textile generated HTML ourselves.</p>

<p>Enjoy</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Greetings. If you have arrived at this page via your own volition and intent
then be aware that this is an abridged, slightly more modern, IRC specific
version of Eric S. Raymond&#8217;s &#8221;<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How to ask questions the smart way</a>&#8221;
which is excellent, but lengthy, reading.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, you have been directed to this page by someone else and
quickly want to find out what this is about, Read on.</p>

<h2>How to ask for help properly</h2>

<p>In short:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t ask to ask</li>
<li>Give the helpers some details</li>
<li>Ask suitable questions</li>
<li>Be polite</li>
<li>Wait</li>
</ul>


<p>For the purposes of this article I will introduce &#8220;Terry&#8221; and &#8220;Gonad&#8221;
(Of &#8221;<a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/130-Alone-in-the-Dark">Zero punctuation</a>&#8221; fame).
Terry shall be our long suffering helper in the &#8220;Spiffy&#8221; project&#8217;s IRC channel
and Gonad shall be the person asking for help (badly).</p>

<h3>1 - Don&#8217;t ask to ask</h3>

<p>This one drives people up the wall and many channels have special bots that will
print out an entire spiel about not asking to ask, so let&#8217;s get it out of the
way first.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[16:00] * Gonad has joined #spiffy-help
</span><span class='line'>[16:00] * Topic is "Welcome to the spiffy help channel. Latest version is 1.5"
</span><span class='line'>[16:00] &lt;Gonad&gt; Is it ok to ask a question about Spiffy?
</span><span class='line'>[16:01] * Terry sobs quietly in the corner</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Let us look at the obvious first. The entire channel is dedicated towards
helping people with Spiffy, this is usually hinted at in the channel name and
outright does in the topic. Do you think they have a personal grudge against
you that is going to stop them answering? (they might possibly later, but right
now it is a blank slate) <strong>of course they can help you</strong>. Just ask the question
straight out.</p>

<p>What Gonad should have done was:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[16:00] * Gonad has joined #spiffy-help
</span><span class='line'>[16:00] * Topic is "Welcome to the spiffy help channel. Latest version is 1.5"
</span><span class='line'>[16:00] &lt;Gonad&gt; Hi all, I am having an issue with ....</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Which leads us nicely onto the next point</p>

<h3>2 - Give the helpers some details.</h3>

<p>Let us follow on from the previous point and continue Gonad&#8217;s sentence.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[16:00] * Gonad has joined #spiffy-help
</span><span class='line'>[16:00] * Topic is "Welcome to the spiffy help channel. Latest version is 1.5"
</span><span class='line'>[16:00] &lt;Gonad&gt; Hi all, I am getting an error page with Spiffy, what is going 
</span><span class='line'>                wrong?
</span><span class='line'>[16:03] &lt;Terry&gt; Wait a moment, I just need to psychically connect with your 
</span><span class='line'>                brain so I can figure out what you are talking about. This may
</span><span class='line'>                cause loss of control over your bodily functions.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Moral of the story, &#8220;Helpers are not psychic&#8221;. When you post a problem we need
something to go on. Preferably some or all of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The error page (Or output thereof).</li>
<li>A list of steps taken which generated this error page and what you are
expecting it to do instead of the error.</li>
<li>The version of the software you are running along with any plugins you might
have installed. If you think it is pertinent then the OS version and Database
if used.</li>
</ul>


<p>A note about including error pages or output. Because these things are
traditionally huge, pasting them directly into the channel will make you as
well liked as a clown at a funeral. Instead use a &#8220;paste&#8221; website like
&#8221;<a href="http://pastie.org">Pastie</a>&#8221;, &#8221;<a href="http://pastebin.com/">Pastebin</a>&#8221; or
&#8221;<a href="http://gist.github.com/">Gist</a>&#8221; and then paste the URL into the channel.
These sites also offer syntax highlighting which is very useful.</p>

<p>If the problem is complicated, or the steps very detailed, then consider posting
a summary in IRC and more detail in your linked paste.</p>

<p>So once more let&#8217;s look at what Gonad should have done.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[16:00] * Gonad has joined #spiffy-help
</span><span class='line'>[16:00] * Topic is "Welcome to the spiffy help channel. Latest version is 1.5"
</span><span class='line'>[16:00] &lt;Gonad&gt; Hi all, I am getting an error page with a new Spiffy 1.5 
</span><span class='line'>                installation when I try and create a second admin user. 
</span><span class='line'>                Steps and Details here: http://pastie.org/417957
</span><span class='line'>[16:02] &lt;Terry&gt; Gasp, what a well formatted cry for help, I rush, RUSH to your 
</span><span class='line'>                aid.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And they all lived happily ever after.</p>

<h3>3 - Ask suitable questions.</h3>

<p>I hang around in some programming channels and every now and then we get a question illustrated by
the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[16:00] * Gonad has joined #programming
</span><span class='line'>[16:00] * Topic is "Welcome to the New Hotness #programming channel"
</span><span class='line'>[16:02] &lt;Gonad&gt; Hi guys, how do I build a search engine / forum / fission reactor 
</span><span class='line'>                cooling loop fluid dynamics modelling application.
</span><span class='line'>[16:07] &lt;Terry&gt; By simply asking that question you have betrayed your inherent 
</span><span class='line'>                cluelessness and I shall now ignore you until the heat death 
</span><span class='line'>                of the universe.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Let us take a real-world equivalent. Your town has a local club of burly men,
covered in engine oil, who like messing around with car engines: tuning, fixing
and the like and they meet every night. Now imagine a someone walks into
their workshop and asks &#8220;Hey guys, I want to design and build an engine, can you
quickly tell me how to do that? I have my notepad and everything&#8221;</p>

<p>Be thankful that at least online you have a certain amount of anonymity and
are not vulnerable to immediate physical retribution.</p>

<p>We are a help channel, this means we usually answer technical questions.
We sometimes answer non-technical questions but don&#8217;t ask anything that will
require an entire business/technical specification or 4 year education course
to answer</p>

<p>Further reading on this subject can be read at the
&#8221;<a href="http://www.slash7.com/pages/vampires">Help Vampire</a>&#8221; site (Which is very funny
and better illustrated that this site). Make sure you don&#8217;t end up as one.</p>

<h3>4 - Be polite</h3>

<p>Common sense dictates that when you put yourself in a position where you are
relying on the kindness of strangers if behoves you to be polite to those
strangers.</p>

<p>Remember how much you paid for the support contract on the software? Exactly.
99.99% of the helpers are not being paid, they are volunteers and generally nice
people doing this because they like the warm fuzzy feeling they get from helping.
Acting like a prat really discourages them from continuing this noble endeavour.</p>

<p>Examples of bad behaviour:</p>

<ul>
<li>Being arrogant.</li>
<li>Discarding/ignoring answers because they aren&#8217;t quick fixes or require
using your brain a bit</li>
<li>Not thinking for yourself and expecting to be spoon fed. (Not Googling your
problem before asking is a prime example).</li>
</ul>


<h3>5 - Wait</h3>

<p>This is the internet, land of many timezones. Therefore questions might not be
answered immediately. Let us look at Gonad again.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[16:00] * Gonad has joined #spiffy-help
</span><span class='line'>[16:00] * Topic is "Welcome to the spiffy help channel. Latest version is 1.5"
</span><span class='line'>[16:00] &lt;Gonad&gt; Hi guys, What is the configuration option for spiffy to enable
</span><span class='line'>                emails?
</span><span class='line'>[16:01] &lt;Gonad&gt; Anyone?
</span><span class='line'>[16:04] &lt;Gonad&gt; Hello?
</span><span class='line'>[16:09] &lt;Gonad&gt; Fine, don't talk to me
</span><span class='line'>[16:10] * Gonad has left #spiffy-help
</span><span class='line'>[16:11] &lt;Terry&gt; Hello guys, back from inventing a cure for cancer, anyone need 
</span><span class='line'>                help?</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Sometimes answers can take hours/days in a relatively quiet channel, state your
question and wait. Most people will type your nick when replying so make sure
your IRC client is set to alert you when your nick is typed.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you have read this far and actually read everything then congratulations.
You should now know enough to not be a prat and get ignored whenever you ask a
question in IRC. However this is only the first step; I still recommend reading
Eric S. Raymond&#8217;s
&#8221;<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How to ask questions the smart way</a>&#8221;
for a more thorough explanation of everything&#8230; go on, don&#8217;t be adequate, go
and be clued up.</p>

<h3>Real Life Examples.</h3>
